Announce for some changes in this project

Hello, we are group 9. We apologize for the late correction.
Goal of this project changed a little. Instead of detecting depression directly, we aim to detect emotions (surprise, sad, etc...) so that it can be used for depression research.

First, you can start your project from this link.

MELD dataset will be used for this project. If you want to read documents, click this link.

Second, dataset have three types of data. Video files and audio included in, and utterance. Details are in link above.
But we found sounds are missing in several data. In this case, please use video and utterance only.

Third, you need to predict their emotions. For example, in "dia0_utt4.mp4" file in train data, Chandler (character) says "My duties?  All right.", and his emotion is surprise. 

If you have any questions about our project, please leave a comment here.

Best,
